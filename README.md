Hi there,

I’m making a career change into software development as I enjoy coding and get a lot of satisfaction out of problem solving.
I’ve grown up on computers, building computers, and being the go to person in the family for any tech issues.
Outside of work I enjoy hiking, camping, and playing board games.

I’m currently studying iO Academy's Software Development Essentials course.
