# Hey, I'm Flo.

I’ve recently made a career change into software development, having completed <a href="https://io-academy.uk/">iO Academy's</a> Software Development Essentials course.

I'm a full stack software developer with experience in ReactJS, PHP, and Laravel. I've developed a core set of skills using Object-Oriented Prgramming, Agile Teamwork, and the ability to learn different languages and tech.

My background is in Showroom Management and Design. I have a wide range of problem solving and teamworking skills and experience I can bring to development.
I’ve also grown up on computers, building computers, and being the go to person in the family for any tech issues.

Outside of work I enjoy hiking, camping, and playing board games.
