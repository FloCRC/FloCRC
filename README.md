Hey,

I’m making a career change into software development as I enjoy coding and get a lot of satisfaction out of problem solving.

I'm a full stack software developer with experience in React.js frontend, and PHP / Laravel backend. I've recently taken iO Academy's Software Development Essentials bootcamp where I created projects using the above technologies.

I’ve grown up on computers, building computers, and being the go to person in the family for any tech issues.
Outside of work I enjoy hiking, camping, and playing board games.
